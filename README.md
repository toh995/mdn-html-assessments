Here you can see my work for the final assessments for [MDN's Introduction to HTML course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML).

MDN has two assessments: [Marking up a letter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Marking_up_a_letter) and [Structuring a page of content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Structuring_a_page_of_content).
